# RabidRush
A post-apocalyptic tower defense insipired by George Romero's 1978 cult classsic Dawn of the Dead.

## Story
After a Zombie outbreak, a group of people decide to stand their position at a shopping mall. They will have to traverse the enormous compound as they fight zombies and loot stores in order to improve their chance of survival.

## Mechanics
Rabid Rush is a classic tower defense with elements taken from different branches of the strategy genre. It's camera resembles the ones from realtime strategy games. It's timer loot system was inspired by puzzle and resource management games, most notably Mini Motorways. There is also room for elements coming from 4x strategy games such as terrain modifiers, flanking bonuses and height bonuses. 

## Visual Style
The visual appearance is a continuation of the nowadays widely popular cel shading style. It resembles the visual language of classic comics and was created with the intention of exploring the use of fashion by zombies and characters alike.

This project is in development.
